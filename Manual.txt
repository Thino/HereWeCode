***********HereWeCode***********

What we have done :
- A REST API which provides places with some criterias. A place allows comments, marks, ... ( See UML Class Diagram ).
- This API can be used with JSON.
- We have used Slim to create our API.
- We have used Geocoder to calculate distances between places and the client.
- We have created a client in HTML/Javascript for use our API ( The php part has no views because we have a HTML client ).
- We have created tests with POSTMAN ( an extension for Google Chrome ). In fact, create tests for an API REST is not 
easy especially if we use authentication in Middleware. So this solution was interesting for test easily our routes. We have 
done somes tests with phpUnit but just for the DataAccessLayer.
- We have used PDO to create our DataAccessLayer. An interface has been created for allow later the possibility of using an
other database ( SQL Server for example ).
- We have described all the REST methods in the page index.php/specs.

What you have to do :
- Install the last version of php
- Install the last version of MySql
- Install an apache server 
- Install the driver PDO
- Install phpunit 
- Create MySql Database with our file Analysis/db_herewecode.sql ( which contains some elements as samples )
- Install phpunit to use our tests for the DAL. Use ( phpunit --config phpunit.xml )
- Install POSTMAN on Google Chrome and import our collection of test ( HereWeCode_Tests.json.txt )
- Update the host or ip address of the serveur which carry the php project in the HTML client ( onload.js)
- Update the dbname/user/password in the file DB/DalMySql.php to connect the MySql database.
- Update the ip/host of every picture in the file Analysis/db_herewecode.sql to match with your location.
- Use option --enable-file-cookies with Chrome for use the HTML client in local.
